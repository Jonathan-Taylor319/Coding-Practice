        # üì¶ Dictionary basics

        # üßµ List comprehension

        # üî™ Slicing & indexing

#have been hammering syntax and basics.... will try to fully cement in to memory and then apply to coding challenges

# --------starting with loop and range drill - 
    #start with triples - groups of 3 - will help range(), len() / and indexing

# nums = [4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1]

#write a loop that:
    # iterated over the list
    # extracts and prints triples
    # adds a comment on why the loop stops and where it does
    # bonus : check to see if the middle value is the largest of the three


# loop - range(len(num)) means we will loop through the length of the whole list
# our -2 means when looping, leave room for 2 more values when interating
# for i in range(len(nums) -2):
#     #-----can be print either way for however we want to use data
#     #print our num's i values:
#     print([nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2]])
#     #i want to see if i can print like this and not another list:
#     print(nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2])
#     #going to add this in to see if i can make one number?
#     print(nums[i] + nums[i +1] + nums[i+2]) # this will sum the numbers
#     #bonus attempt - check to see if middle number is highest value
#     a = nums[i]
#     b = nums[i+1]
#     c = nums[i+2]
#     if b > c and b > a:
#         print(f"{b} is the king of the castle! woo wow wee wow!")
#     else:
#         print(f"{b} needs to eat more veggies and grow up!")

#         #a king is if the middle var is the biggest  so.....

# -----------------back to dictionaries-----------------
# a dict in python is like a locker
#     -put stuff in usina label(key)
#     -you retrieve it using the label
#     -and if you lose the key you'r locked out forever

# example of a basic dictionary
# book = {"title": "Dune", "author": "Frank Herbert"}
# print(book["title"]) prints just the title
# print(book) - prints the whole dict


#-------MUST-KNOW Methods-----------
#1
#.get(key, default)
#returns the value for key, or the default if it doesn't exist

# .get does not
#     create new keys
#     mutuate the dictionary

# it only prevents errors if the key does not exist

# inventory = {"sword":2} 
# print(inventory.get("shield", 0)) #returns 0 instead of crashing
# print(inventory.get("hammer", 1))
# # print(inventory)

# 2
# .items()
# returns all key - value pairs as tuples(jump in to tuples below) great for looping
#     for item, count in inventory.items():
#     print(item, count)

# 3
# .keys() and .values ()
# .keys() = all keys
# .values() = all values
# (Useful for checking existence, sorting, etc.)

#-------TUPLE------
#a tuple is an immutable sequence in python, like a list but it can't be changed

# my_tuple = (1,2,3)
# ‚úÖ Ordered

# ‚úÖ Indexable

# ‚úÖ Iterable

# ‚ùå Cannot add/remove/change elements

# ---- tuples can be any size and even empty

# return multiple values from a function
#     the default return type when you return more than one thing

#     def get_name():
#     return ("Ada", "Lovelace")

#     first, last = get_name()

#     dictionary .items() gives tuples

#     d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
#     for key, value in d.items():
#         print((key, value))  # ('a', 1), ('b', 2)

#     immutability = saftey
#         - you want a collectection of values to stay fixed
#         - you're using the data as a dictionary key

#         coords = (5, 9)
#         positions[coords] = "enemy spotted"

#         ‚úã How Are They Different From Lists?
# Feature	List ([])	Tuple (())
# Mutable?	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No
# Indexable?	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes
# Iterable?	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes
# Can change?	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå Locked forever
# Good for?	Changing data	||    Fixed, safe data
# Used in?	Loops, stacking	||    Coordinates, returns

# first dictionary drill ---

# write a function called count_names(lst)
#     it should take a list of names as strings
#     return a  dict
#         each unique name as a key
#         how many times it appears as a value

# names = ["Ada", "Bob", "Ada", "Eve", "Bob", "Ada", "Carl"]


# # üß† Required:
# # Use .get() to avoid KeyError tantrums

# # No if name in dict: checking

# # No collections.Counter cheat codes

# # Keep it caveman-level logic

# name_thing = {}
# def count_names(lst):
#     for i in names:
#         name_thing[i] = name_thing.get(i, 0) + 1
#     return name_thing

# print(count_names(names))


#-------practice drill 2-------

# votes = ["Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Derek", "Bob", "Alice", "Alice", "Derek"]

# # created a function that is a list of votes / each vote is a name / count votes for candidates/ use .get()
# vote_count = {}

# def count_votes(votes):
#     for h in votes:
#         vote_count[h] = vote_count.get(h, 0) + 1
#     return vote_count
    
# print(count_votes(votes))
