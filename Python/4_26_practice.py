# üß† REAL ASSESSMENT-STYLE CHALLENGE: ‚ÄúMost Common Triplet‚Äù
# ‚ùì Prompt:
# You are given a list of strings representing user-submitted search queries.
# Each query is a single word. You must analyze all groups of 3 consecutive queries (triplets) and identify the most commonly occurring triplet.
# Your task:
# Write a function that scans through the list and tracks how often each triplet appears.
# Return the triplet that appeared most frequently, and how many times it appeared.

# words = ["apple", "banana", "carrot", "date", "elderberry"]

# for i in range(len(words) -1):
#     pair = (words[i], words[i+1])
#     print("PAIR", pair)

#     pair = (words[i], words[i+1])
#     print("PAIR :", pair)

# for in range(len(list) -2)
#     declare a var for the items i want to pul out





# # ("cat", "dog", "fish")  ‚ûú 3

# üí• Requirements:
# Use .get() to track counts (no defaultdict, no Counter)
# Use range() smartly to avoid index errors
# Return the most common triplet and how many times it appeared
# Do not use fancy imports ‚Äî built-in Python only
